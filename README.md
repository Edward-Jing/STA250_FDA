# STA250 FDA Code and Results

This repository contains the implementation and results for our STA 250 Final Project: **Time Dynamics of COVID-19: Deep Learning-Based Methods**. The project explores time-series forecasting of COVID-19 case counts at the county/state level using three different methods:

- **(Naive) Neural Network** - A simple neural network with reconstruction and forecasting branches.
- **Frozen Autoencoder (FAE)** - A two-stage model where an autoencoder is trained first, and then its latent representations are used for forecasting.
- **Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA)** - A feature extraction approach that uses functional decomposition to construct regression models for forecasting.
